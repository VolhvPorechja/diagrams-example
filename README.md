[Diagram as a Code](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/)

Diagram as Code is an approach where diagrams are generated using text-based configuration files, rather than being manually drawn using a GUI tool. This approach has several advantages:

* Version control: Since the diagrams are text-based, they can be easily tracked and versioned using standard version control systems like Git. This makes it easier to collaborate on diagrams, review changes, and maintain a history of the diagrams.
* Automation: Diagrams can be automatically generated, updated, and incorporated into your documentation, webpages, or other artifacts as part of your CI/CD pipeline. This ensures that your diagrams always stay up-to-date with the latest changes in your system.
* Consistency: By using a common set of styles and conventions across all your diagrams, you can enforce consistency and improve the overall quality of your documentation.
* Reusability: With Diagram as Code, you can create reusable templates and components, which can be easily shared across your team or organization. This helps in reducing duplication of effort and promotes the use of best practices.
* Readability: Text-based diagrams can be more readable and easier to understand than complex visual diagrams, especially when it comes to describing large or complicated systems. They can also be easily searched and navigated using standard text-editing tools.
* Collaboration: As the diagrams are code-based, it becomes easier for team members to collaborate on them, suggest changes, and discuss their design. This can lead to more efficient and effective communication.

Diagram as Code is a powerful approach that promotes consistency, automation, version control, and collaboration in creating and maintaining diagrams. It helps in keeping the documentation up-to-date and reduces the overall effort required to manage and maintain diagrams.
